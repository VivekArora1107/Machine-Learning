# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning projects, where I explore various algorithms and techniques. The projects here cover a range of different datasets, problems, and solutions that I've learned through my coursework at **George Brown College** and tutorials from **Jovianâ€™s YouTube Channel**.

## Projects

### 1. **Linear Regression Model**
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the use of **Linear Regression** to predict numerical values based on independent variables.
- **Techniques Used**: Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Model Evaluation.
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset for regression analysis.

### 2. **Logistic Regression Model (Weather Dataset)**
- **Description**: This project applies **Logistic Regression** to classify weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- **Techniques Used**: Classification, Evaluation Metrics.
- **Dataset**: Weather data used for classification tasks.

### 3. **Decision Trees and Random Forest (Weather Dataset)**
- **Description**: Implemented **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** models for weather classification.
- **Techniques Used**: Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning (Random Forest).
- **Dataset**: Weather dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For model building and data manipulation. (Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment for running Python code and visualizing results.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
